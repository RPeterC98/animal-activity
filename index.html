        <p>     ♣ The tiger is the biggest species of the cat family.<br>

                ♣ Tigers can reach a length of up to 3.3 metres (11 feet) and weigh as much as 300 kilograms (660 pounds).<br>
                
                ♣ Subspecies of the tiger include the Sumatran Tiger, Siberian Tiger, Bengal Tiger, South China Tiger, Malayan Tiger and Indochinese Tiger.<br>
                
                ♣ Many subspecies of the tiger are either endangered or already extinct. Humans are the primary cause of this through hunting and the destruction of habitats.<br>
                
                ♣ Around half of tiger cubs don’t live beyond two years of age.<br>
                
                ♣ Tiger cubs leave their mother when they are around 2 years of age.<br>
                
                ♣ A group of tigers is known as an ‘ambush’ or ‘streak’.<br>
                
                ♣ Tigers are good swimmers and can swim up to 6 kilometres.<br>
                
                ♣ Rare white tigers carry a gene that is only present in around 1 in every 10000 tigers.<br>
                
                ♣ Tigers usually hunt alone at night time.<br>
                
                ♣ Tigers have been known to reach speeds up to 65 kph (40 mph).<br>
                
                ♣ Less than 10% of hunts end successfully for tigers<br>
                
                ♣ Tigers can easily jump over 5 metres in length.<br>
                
                ♣ Various tiger subspecies are the national animals of Bangladesh, India, North Korea, South Korea and Malaysia.<br>
                
                ♣ There are more tigers held privately as pets than there are in the wild.<br>
                
                ♣ Tigers that breed with lions give birth to hybrids known as tigons and ligers.
